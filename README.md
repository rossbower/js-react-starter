# js-starter with react

I implemented the assignment by creating two classes (Note and App) which were smart components and one dumb component (InputBar). The notes are able to be created, editable, moveable, and deletable. It was a little tricky to figure out how to get information passed between components, but I feel much more comfortable with that now. I still am not sure what bind does for functions that are written, and I also aim to improve my SCSS coding style now that I have experience with it.

Some things I added:
  Adding position tracking so no notes take on the positions of other notes upon a delete.
  Created a simple formula to stack notes diagonally upon creation of multiple notes.
  Cleared the input bar upon submit.

As you can see, I attempted to implement the zIndex tracking, and I will hopefully add that feature before the next part is due.
